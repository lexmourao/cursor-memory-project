# Cursor Operational Rules

These rules are interpreted by the **Cursor AI assistant** when interacting with this repository.

## 1. Memory & Context
- Maintain a rolling summary of each interaction in `diary/project_log.md`.
- Before acting, review the **CONTEXT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** in `docs/CONTEXT_VERIFICATION.md`.
- When reading files, retrieve them in chunks of **â‰¤ 200 lines**. Do **not** worry about token usage limits.
- Proactively surface relevant past context to avoid circular work or duplicated effort.

## 2. Logging & Status
- Log **all errors** with `scripts/log_error.py`.
- Update status / checklists with `scripts/update_status.py`.
- Important actions should also be appended to `diary/project_log.md`.

## 3. No-Deletion Policy
- Never delete files; move outdated artefacts to `archive-cursor_memory_project/`.

## 4. Folder Consistency
- Preserve the directory structure defined in `PROJECT_RULES.md`.
- New files must live in the appropriate folder; if unsure, consult `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 5. Security & Compliance
- Follow the guidelines in `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- Sensitive data belongs in `data/raw/` and must remain immutable.

## 6. Automation
- Prefer scripted actions over manual editing.
- Re-run tests (`pytest`) before committing any code changes.

## 7. External Context Loader
- On session start, **fetch long-term memory** from `http://localhost:7331/memory` (local MCP server).
- Retry up to 3 times if the endpoint is not yet available.

Adherence to these rules ensures that the Cursor assistant retains context, avoids infinite loops, and keeps the project state transparent and reproducible.
